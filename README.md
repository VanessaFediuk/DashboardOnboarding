# DashboardOnboarding

This contains an onboaring solution for Microsoft Power BI dashboards.

The folder DashboardOnboardingReactApp contains a fully working solution. Where you only need to add your IDs in the Config file.

The OnboardingCode folder contains purly the onboarding relevant code. In Typescript and Javascript. To try it out yourself you need to add this to your embedded Microsoft Power BI solution. For example, in an AppOwnsData application the onboarding folder would be added into the wwwroot folder.
